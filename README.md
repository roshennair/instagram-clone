# Instagram Clone

An Instagram-like photo sharing mobile application built using React Native, Expo, Google Firebase, and Redux.

**DISCLAIMER**: I did not design/build this project entirely by myself, although I have made some modifications and improvements over the original design. I created it as a code-along project for SimCoder's excellent tutorial, [Build an Instagram Clone with React Native, Firebase Firestore, Redux, Expo - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hPgQWbWmEk).

## What I learned:

- Created a new React Native project using Expo.
- Implemented basic in-app navigation using StackNavigator.
- Implemented email-password authentication using Firebase Authentication.
- Used Redux for fetching and managing app state.
- Implemented bottom tab navigation using TabNavigator.
